# AI-Diver

In this game, the diver has to collect pearls from the ocean ground as fast
													as possible. 
													The basic mechanics of this game were already provided by our professor. Our job was
													to write an A.I. which finds the quickest way to collect all 10 pearls. 
													Meanwhile, we also had to avoid piranhas and currents, and come back to the
													surface before the air runs out.
